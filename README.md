# Misc

This is a collection of my miscellaneous coding stuff, probably in python because its quick and easy. Expect many bugs, bad code, and nonsense! Many of it is probably unfinished as well, I just keep it all here so I can keep track of it, and cross reference stuff I've already written.

The "Unfinished" folder in the `.gitignore` is for *really* unfinished stuff, that I might delete.
