# Advent of Code 2021

This is going to be my first advent of code and I've decided to do it in C (and maybe C++ if I have a reason to).

I'd like to thank the organizers for making this and hosting the challenge, and I hope that I am able to learn something and broaden my skills!

The challenges are available [here](https://adventofcode.com/2021/)!
