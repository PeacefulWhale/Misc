# Day 17 Challenge A & B

The elves say "HI"...

All that work, for "HI"? It wasn't *that* much work, but still...

Oh wait, there's more.

They're sending down more supplies in a mini submarine thing. That's good. Though I'd rather have gone back up to the ship to refuel and stuff...

Regardless I've got a new obstacle in front of me. There's a trench down here that I've got to map. However I have to send a probe in first. Something about giant-giant squids?

I've only got one shot, I better make this right. And maybe cool. What about both?

## **Code Writeup**

Today is a pretty dang chill day. I solved part A with a simple summation formula on my TI-84.

For part B I calculated the minimum and maximum values that the velocity could be, and then brute force checked all these possible values.

I probably could have figured out how to do this another formula instead of brute forcing part B, but I was feeling very lazy. Also simulating them is pretty quick, likely just as quick as whatever formula I'd devise. The only thing that I can imagine significantly improving this would be a way of finding more accurate minium and maximum values, maybe make it so we don't have to actually simulate anything.
