# Day 11 Challenge A & B

Octopuses. Octopi? Octopussi?

Whatever I guess.

They're cute little guys but I don't have time to stop by, I need to get out of this cave system. Only one small problem: the submarine refuses to leave until we analyze them.

Just my luck...

## **Code Writeup**

Today was pretty easy. I essentially just copied my day 9 code and modified it a little bit to get it working for today. Other than that there wasn't much else to do.

Maybe I'll visualize the flashing of the octopi latter, it would be cool to see the synchronization take place.
